							<h2>IT Work</h2>
							<p>We are very honored to interview a professional IT professional who has been in the business for 20 years. By talking with him, all the team members benefited a lot.</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
									<h3>Q1: Which direction do you think the IT industry will develop in the future</h3>
									<p>PBig data technology, AI. Big data will change people's living conditions, making it easier for people to understand their needs. AI will change the world. There will be a lot of job types that will be completely replaced by AI.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-lock"></span>
									<h3>Q2:What do you think is the biggest challenge facing staff in the IT industry now </h3>
									<p>IT is a fast-growing industry, and all practitioners must constantly learn new knowledge and technologies, otherwise they will only be slowly eliminated. And as technology changes with each passing day, more and more IT positions require employees with multiple skills.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>Q3:What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</h3>
									<p>This is a very broad problem. When I first entered the industry, I needed to constantly program, test, and fix bugs. Gradually, I need to communicate with the team about product interactions, functions, etc., and need to adapt to changing market conditions at any time</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>Q4:What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT  professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public? </h3>
									<p>This is a more interesting question. I personally think that IT practitioners need to communicate with their customers about their product needs. They need to ensure that investors understand the current working situation, and they need to communicate with the same professional knowledge, share knowledge and work together progress.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-link"></span>
									<h3>Q5:Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h3>
									<p>Well, generally speaking, we will spend more time on technical pre-research, which means that when someone proposes a functional requirement, but is not sure whether it can be achieved, it needs some professionals to study together and build a small demo Try it. Once successful, it can be added to other products to improve their brand effectiveness</p>

									<h3>Aliquam urna dapibus</h3>
									<p>Phasellus convallis elit id ullam corper amet et pulvinar. Duis aliquam turpis mauris, sed ultricies erat dapibus.</p>
								</section>
                                <section>
									<span class="icon major fa-gem"></span>
									<h3>Q6:What aspect of their position is most challenging?  </h3>
									<p>Similarly, technical pre-research. Also because you will be faced with a brand new, untouched function, you have no clue about this and need a little exploration.</p>
